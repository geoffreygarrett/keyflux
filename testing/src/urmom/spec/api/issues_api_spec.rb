  # Get an issue

If the issue was deleted from a repository where the authenticated user has read access, the API returns a &#x60;410 Gone&#x60; status.

For this reason, \&quot;Issues\&quot; endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the &#x60;pull_request&#x60; key.
